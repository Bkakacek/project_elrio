with user-defined style sheets and to improve accessibility.

[CSE] Message number 5 in line 30:1:
It's recommended that "*.picture" be used instead of
".picture" so that the universal selector (*) is explicit
instead of implied. Using explicit universal selectors can
decrease confusion and improve readability. This message is
displayed up to 3 times.

[CSE] Message number 6 in line 32:5:
Note that the "border" shorthand property resets all border
properties, including "border-image", to its initial value.
Therefore, use the "border" shorthand, rather than other
shorthands or the individual properties, to override any
border settings earlier in the cascade. This will ensure
that "border-image" has also been reset to allow the new
styles to take effect. This message is displayed only once.

[CSE] Warning number 1 in line 63:10:
Many mobile devices use touch screens making ":hover"
problematic, cumbersome, or impossible to use. Depending on
the browser, ":hover" might never match, or it might match
for brief moments, or until the user touches another
element. Ensure that content is never only accessible or
only visible by hovering. This message is displayed only
once.

[CSE] Comment number 1:
[73] Section 508 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 2:
[73] WCAG 1.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 3:
[73] WCAG 2.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 4:
Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

[CSE] Comment number 5:
